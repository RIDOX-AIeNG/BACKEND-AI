In more realistic projects, you'd pull delivery logs from a data source and fix errors or missing values. For this lab, that work is already done, but with a twist. This isn't the same data from the lecture videos. You're looking at a different set of deliveries, which means your model might find a different pattern and make a different prediction for that 7-mile delivery.\n",
